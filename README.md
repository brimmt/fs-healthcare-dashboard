#  AI-Driven Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

A full-stack healthcare analytics project focused on **AP Theorem–aligned architecture**, **safe AI integration**, and **modernizing legacy healthcare systems**.  
Each milestone will include **unit testing** to ensure correctness, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

This project began as a **50,000+ row Excel dataset** that I fully cleaned and transformed to strengthen my data-engineering fundamentals. It has since evolved into a robust analytics dashboard featuring:

- AI-generated insights  
- REST API endpoints (transitioning from simulated SOAP → REST)  
- SAM.gov API ingestion  
- Clean, normalized data models  
- Reverse-proxy concept to hide SOAP endpoints while exposing REST endpoints for AI  
- A roadmap toward a lightweight EHR simulation

##  Why I Built This

Healthcare tech isn’t slow because of lack of talent — it’s slow because of **legacy infrastructure**, **technical debt**, and **regulatory pressure**. Many organizations still rely on:

- SOAP-based APIs  
- Outdated interfaces  
- Siloed datasets  
- Strict PHI and compliance requirements  
- Slow modernization timelines  

This project simulates how a real healthcare organization can:

- Transition safely from **SOAP → REST**  
- Introduce AI ethically (no PHI, safe reasoning, explainable results)  
- Use reverse proxies to keep old endpoints hidden  
- Improve data workflows without system disruption  
- Move toward a modern, future-safe architecture  

It reflects my background in **clinical informatics**, **software engineering**, and **AI automation** — and demonstrates how AI can be integrated responsibly inside regulated environments.

- Expanded REST endpoints  
- Healthcare workflow simulation (admissions, conditions, billing, outcomes)  
- Basic SOAP emulation layer  
- Docker & CI/CD integration  
- Production deployment  
- Automated tests added at each milestone 
- AI integration
